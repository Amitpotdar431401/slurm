4. Submit a Job and Explain the Output

Submit a job and analyze the behavior based on the preemption configurations.

Command to Submit a Job:

sbatch --partition=exam --time=00:05:00 --job-name=test_job test_script.sh

Replace test_script.sh with the name of your job script.

Explanation of the Output:

1. With PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio:

Jobs in a higher-priority partition preempt lower-priority jobs.

Preempted jobs are suspended or terminated depending on the PreemptMode.



2. With PreemptType=preempt/qos:

Jobs with a higher Quality of Service (QoS) value preempt those with lower QoS.

Preempted jobs behave as defined in PreemptMode.
